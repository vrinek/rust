<p>If you see this message: <code>error: internal compiler error: unexpected panic</code>,
then you have definitely found a bug in the compiler. It&#39;s also possible that
your code is not well-typed, but if you saw this message, it&#39;s still a bug in
error reporting.</p>

<p>If you see a message about an LLVM assertion failure, then you have also
definitely found a bug in the compiler. In both of these cases, it&#39;s not your
fault and you should report a bug!</p>

<p>If you see a compiler error message that you think is meant for users to see,
but it confuses you, <em>that&#39;s a bug too</em>. If it wasn&#39;t clear to you, then it&#39;s
an error message we want to improve, so please report it so that we can try
to make it better.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-know-the-bug-i-found-isn&#39;t-a-bug-that-already-exists-in-the-issue-tracker?" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#how-do-i-know-the-bug-i-found-isn&#39;t-a-bug-that-already-exists-in-the-issue-tracker?">2 How do I know the bug I found isn&#39;t a bug that already exists in the issue tracker?</a></h1>
<p>If you don&#39;t have enough time for a search, then don&#39;t worry about that. Just submit
the bug. If it&#39;s a duplicate, somebody will notice that and close it during triage.</p>

<p>If you have the time for it, it would be useful to type the text of the error
message you got <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues">into the issue tracker search box</a>
to see if there&#39;s an existing bug that resembles your problem. If there is,
and it&#39;s an open bug, you can comment on that issue and say you are also affected.
This will encourage the devs to fix it. But again, don&#39;t let this stop you from
submitting a bug. We&#39;d rather have to do the work of closing duplicates than
miss out on valid bug reports.</p>

<h1 id="what-information-should-i-include-in-a-bug-report?" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#what-information-should-i-include-in-a-bug-report?">3 What information should I include in a bug report?</a></h1>
<p>It generally helps our diagnosis to include your specific OS (for example: Mac OS X 10.8.3,
Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04) and your hardware architecture (for example: i686, x86_64).
It&#39;s also helpful to provide the exact version and host by copying the output of
re-running the erroneous rustc command with the <code>--version --verbose</code> flags, which will
produce something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">rustc 0.12.0 (ba4081a5a 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700)
binary: rustc
commit-hash: ba4081a5a8573875fed17545846f6f6902c8ba8d
commit-date: 2014-10-07 13:44:41 -0700
host: i686-apple-darwin
release: 0.12.0
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, if you can also provide a backtrace, that&#39;d be great. You can get a
backtrace by setting the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to <code>1</code>, like
this: </p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustc ...
</code></pre>

<h1 id="i-submitted-a-bug,-but-nobody-has-commented-on-it!" class='section-header'><a
                           href="#i-submitted-a-bug,-but-nobody-has-commented-on-it!">4 I submitted a bug, but nobody has commented on it!</a></h1>
<p>This is sad, but does happen sometimes, since we&#39;re short-staffed. If you
submit a bug and you haven&#39;t received a comment on it within 3 business days,
it&#39;s entirely reasonable to either ask on the #rust IRC channel,
or post on the <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/rust-dev">rust-dev mailing list</a>
to ask what the status of the bug is.</p>
